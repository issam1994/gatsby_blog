One upon a time, there was an amazing pairing app called Screenhero.

One upon a time, there was an amazing pairing app called Screenhero.

Sadly, they decided to sell to Slack, who tried to integrate them, failed, and eventually shut them down.

In the following years, we made do with generic screensharing tools.

It's not terrible pairing over Zoom, but it was clearly built for business types. They even call it a “meeting” in their UI.

And Slack Calls is fine, but not having remote control is a deal-breaker. Have you ever tried to dictate some code for your pair to write? Or narrated a set of Vim commands? Not fun.

Another problem: if you’re going to type on a remote machine, the connection has to be low-latency. This is the sort of thing that generic screen sharing tools just don’t care much about.

```javascript
<div> Hi there</div>
<div> Hi there</div>
<div> Hi there</div>

```css
.myclass {

}
```

After much deliberation, the three of us (Ben, Joel, and Spencer) quit our cushy dev jobs, started living off our savings, and dove into the problem full-time.

It's been a ton of work, but we finally have something we've always wanted: a fast, lightweight tool built for nitpicky developers like ourselves. One that sweats the details programmers care about like efficient CPU usage, no UI chrome, and 5K-quality video stream. A tool that fades into the background and lets you focus on being a great pair.

We're proud of Tuple, and we hope you like it.

Love,

Ben, Joel, and Spencer.
